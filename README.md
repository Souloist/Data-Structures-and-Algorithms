# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Here I will have implementation of various data structures and algorithms in java/python/Matlab. I will discuss the following data structures/algorithms and their pros/cons

**Data Structures**

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Dequeues
- Hash Tables
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps

**Algorithms**

- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

**Signal Processing Related Algorithms**
- Harr Transform
- Daubechies transform
- Gradient Descent 
- Least Squares Convolution

# Tests

Tests can be run with `python tests/test_something.py`
