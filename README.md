Here I will have implementation of various data structures and algorithms in java/python/Matlab. I will discuss the following data structures/algorithms and their pros/cons

**Data Structures**

1. Lists
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Dequeues 
6. Binary Trees
7. Binary Search Trees
8. Hash Tables

**Algorithms**

1. Selection sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Harr Transform
5. Daubechies transform
6. Gradient Descent 
7. Least Squares Convolution
